    "In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app.  At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  \n",
